### Ride service types
`POST /rides` accepts:
- `serviceType`: `RIDE_ONLY`, `GUIDE_ONLY`, or `RIDE_AND_GUIDE`
- `purpose`: optional rider-selected trip purpose
- `paymentMethod`: `RAZORPAY`, `UPI`, `CARD`, `CASH`, or `WALLET`

### Recovery
- `interrupt` is authenticated and allowed for the rider, current assigned driver, or admin while the ride is `IN_PROGRESS`.
- `recover` is authenticated and allowed for the rider, current assigned driver, or admin while the ride is `INTERRUPTED`.
- Recovery reuses the existing dispatch assignment model, selects an approved/available replacement driver when one is not explicitly supplied, and returns the ride to `ASSIGNED` with an `OFFERED` replacement assignment.
- Recovery accepts an optional `idempotencyKey` to make repeated recovery requests safe.

## Dispatch

## Admin
Admin endpoints are under `/admin` and require explicit permissions:
`users.read`, `users.manage`, `drivers.verify`, `guides.verify`, `rides.manage`, `payments.refund`, `emergency.manage`, `notifications.manage`, `settings.manage`, etc.

## API rules
- Validate all request bodies.
- Return stable machine-readable error codes.
- Use cursor pagination for large operational lists.
- Require an `Idempotency-Key` HTTP header for booking, payment, guide-assignment, trusted-contact, emergency and recording mutations protected by the server middleware. Reusing a key with different request data is rejected.
- Enforce authorization server-side on every endpoint.
- Never return more location precision or personal data than necessary.

## Language APIs
- GET `/languages`
- GET `/languages/recommended`
- GET `/users/me/language`
- PATCH `/users/me/language`
- GET `/users/me/spoken-language-preferences`
- PATCH `/users/me/spoken-language-preferences`
- GET `/providers/:id/languages`

Recommendations may use coarse region when available; they must never silently change the account preference.
