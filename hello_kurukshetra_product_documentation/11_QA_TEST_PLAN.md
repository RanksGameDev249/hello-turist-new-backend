11. Load/performance tests
12. End-to-end tests

## Critical scenarios
### Auth
OTP success/failure/rate-limit, Google auth, expired refresh token, logout-all.

### Verification
Document upload, invalid file, expired document, rejection, resubmission, live verification, permission checks.

### Booking
Quote, confirmation, duplicate request, no supply, assignment timeout, driver rejection, cancellation.

### Trip
Arriving, arrived, start, progress, completion, GPS loss, network loss, reconnect and process death.

### Interrupted ride
Freeze state, compute completed segment, replacement assignment, transparent fare adjustment, no double charge.

### Guide
Pickup discovery, destination discovery, filters, availability and independent assignment.

### Payments
Success, failure, delayed webhook, duplicate webhook, refund, partial refund, cash.

### Emergency
SOS, duplicate SOS prevention, acknowledgement, responder assignment, escalation, arrival, resolution, audit.

### Safety heartbeat
GPS unavailable, network unavailable, backgrounded app, force-stop and device-off limitations.

### Security
Unauthorized role access, IDOR, privilege escalation, malicious upload, rate-limit bypass, webhook spoofing, token reuse.

## Release criteria
Zero open critical/high security defects, critical E2E paths passing, payment reconciliation validated, emergency workflows simulated, acceptable crash-free rate and performance budgets met.
## Localization tests
Test signup language selection, device-locale detection, regional recommendations, persistence, manual changes, notification localization, missing-translation fallback, spoken-language matching, RTL readiness and offline behavior. Verify location recommendations never override explicit language.
